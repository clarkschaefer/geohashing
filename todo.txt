Starting with the set of current dji dates
need to work backward to find first valid one
use the supplied date, but only the most recent weekday open
so only return the value if the weekday value of the date <= 4



todo:
add better error messages
    data not yet available when DJI hasn't opened yet
    this error is here, but I don't really know how exceptions work yet
use literally anything other than alphavantage
    nothing yet, but it does mean implementing other data sources in the future
use more than ipinfo.io
    need to find some alternate geoip sources
add a testing suite
    python or shell script?
    probably python so that it can be tested platform independent
verify platform independence
    ez, maybe
automatic API key generation and storage
    verify that this isn't against AV ToS
    make the script display itself so people know you aren't stealing API keys
